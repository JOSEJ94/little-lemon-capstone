# Final Project - Meta React Native Developer Certificate

## Overview

This project is the culmination of the skills acquired throughout the Meta React Native Developer Certificate on Coursera. It showcases a comprehensive application built using **React Native**, **Expo**, and other modern mobile development technologies. The goal is to create an engaging, user-friendly mobile experience with real-world functionality and performance.

## Features

- **Responsive Design**: Ensures seamless experience on both iOS and Android devices.
- **Navigation**: Smooth and intuitive multi-page navigation with animations.
- **Custom Components**: Reusable components designed to streamline development and maintain a clean codebase.
- **API Integration**: Real-time data fetching and rendering.
